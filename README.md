Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:michalwachowicz/inventory-app.git
cd inventory-app
npm install

### Setting up the database

#### Updaing environment variables

Rename `.env.copy` file to `.env` and fill the values with your database credentials in the format specified in the file

#### Setting up the password

You need to set up the password in order to be able to perform CRUD operations inside the app. To set the password use the following command:

npm run db:password <new password>

This step is optional as you can also start with an empty state and use your own data. After configuring the ENV file, simply run the following command to generate the sample data in your database:

```bash
npm run db:generate

You can also modify the sample data before generating by editing the `./src/db/sample-data.ts` file
